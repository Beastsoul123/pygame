# Ping-Pong Game

This is a simple **Ping-Pong** game created using **Pygame**. The game allows two players to control paddles and hit a bouncing ball. The goal is to score points by making the opponent miss the ball.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode:** One player controls the right paddle, and the other controls the left paddle.
- **Ball Physics:** The ball moves at a constant speed and bounces off the walls and paddles.
- **Scoring System:** The score increases when the opponent fails to return the ball.
- **Background Music:** A looping background sound plays during the game.
